## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why.**
This project is called Yohance's Corner. It uses Yelp's Fusion API to return JSON output at specific routes. The purpose of the web app being to render results speciic to a user's search query for different businesses and event listings.

The current status of my project is in need of proposal approval. I want to improve my BEW skills in Django while refining this project. I enjoyed learning the Django framework in Term 3 and would love to create a portfolio piece in a concentration outside of my own (Mobile). Also, I had trouble in BEW so it'd be cool to gain some sort of mastery.

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project.**

I anticipate that I may have trouble rendering new app routes. 
I anticipate that I may have trouble setting up User Authentification. 
I anticipate that I may have trouble deploying to Heroku. 
I anticipate that I may have trouble rendering new app routes. 

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

I want to build a better frontend and have a super nice homepage.

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use.**

See how I can pull data from a database (pictures, text, comments etc...) and then I would have a way to grab external data. 

## Car
**ONE additional feature.**

User Sign in/Register for website (Authentification)


## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.** 

1. Time-management.
2. Solving the problems I face by finding solutions on the internet and friends.
3. Breaking my tasks into smaller parts.
4. Creating a solid portfolio piece.
